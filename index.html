           <h2> About The Great Pyramid </h2>
            <br>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The Pyramids of Giza are the oldest pyramids to have been built some 4,500 years ago between <strong> 2560 </strong> and <strong> 2540 BCE.</strong> They are the only remaining and intact structures amongst the <strong> Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. </strong> </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>The Great Pyramid also known as <strong> Khufu's Pyramid </strong> is the most magnificent structure to have been ever built. It was the tallest man-made structure standing at a height of <strong> 481 ft </strong> and remained so for about 3,800 years. Along with the pyramids of <strong> Menkaure </strong> and <strong> Khafre </strong>, it is perfectly aligned with the constellation of <strong> Orion. </strong> </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>The pyramid is a combination of white limestones and granite which have been transported from different parts of Giza. It has been estimated that, about 2.3 million stone blocks were used to build the pyramid. It is believed that, it took 20,000 workers almost 20 years to complete the <strong> Great Pyramid.</strong> </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Inside the pyramid are the three major chambers: the <strong> King's Chamber, </strong> the <strong> Queen's Chamber </strong> and the <strong> Grand Gallery.</strong> Out of all chambers, the King's Chamber is at the highest point in the pyramid and contains a large granite sarcophagus. </li>
              </ul>
